# Aviation Glossary

! mock up will go here 

## Introduction
This is my third Milestone project on the Code Institute Full Stack software developer course.

Aviation Glossary is an online dictionary of phraseology, abbreviations and radio calls that are used in Aviation. It is aimed at both experienced aviators and people who 
have an interest in aviation and would like to know more about the kind of language used in the skies.
Before beginning this course, I spend 4 years training and working as a commercial pilot and aviation is my greatest passion in life.
I chose this project idea because I wanted to create something useful to the aviation community, and to be able to use my apply my own knowledge and keep current.

Aviation Glossary is a full-stack site.
